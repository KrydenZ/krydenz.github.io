# krydenz.github.io

Welcome to my personal blog: [krydenz.github.io](https://krydenz.github.io)

The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and maintains a heavily customised version of the original HuxBlog theme. Front-end assets (LESS/CSS/JS) can be rebuilt locally with Grunt if you need to tweak the design.

## Local development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you change files inside `less/` or `js/hux-blog.js`, install the Node tooling once and rebuild assets:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Credits

The design originally came from the excellent work by [qiubaiying](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io) and has been adapted to fit my needs.
